#Scope
In this project, students will be creating a JavaScript MadLibs game using string replacement, alerts and prompts.
 
#Before Class
Take a look at the [Starter Code]() and [Solution Code.]() Become familiar with the two documents as you will be using them in class.

#During Class

##Do Now
As the students walk into class ask them to take a look at some MadLibs games you have prepared. Either a MadLibs book or a few good electronic sources you may have,

##Opening
Today we're going to build Mad Libs! This game will be VERY similar to the MadLibs we created in Scratch during unit one. The difference this time is we will be creating this game in JavaScript.  
The program will ask the user for different types of words (verbs, nouns, numbers, colors). Once we have their responses, we are going take a story and replace the blanks with the user's responses!

##Lecture
Today in class you are all going to make...[Here]() is an example of one that we(the teachers) made before class.

##Project Creation Time
#####Brianstorming/Prototyping

#####Build Time
Students may work alone or pair program (teachers should use their own discretion.) The teacher's role will be to walk around the room helping students with any quesitons they have. Students are encouraged to look at previous lessons for reference.

##Closing
~~Will the studetns present these projects? How will the teacher end this project?~~

##Check for Understanding
Teachers should keep track of student success while they are presenting to the class.

##How to Submit
The teacher must ask students to share the link to their project on your school's [Project Submission Form.](https://docs.google.com/a/scripted.org/spreadsheets/d/1kaVH9hmkDCbBul19583UMPxl6IJ3-4pHgBQ2BU6TKDk/edit#gid=0)
