#Project 4 - SoundMood
![Image](http://wpsolutions-hq.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/sc_set.jpg)

##Scope
This is a project that will allow students to play with the SoundCloud API, as well their HTML5 widget. They will build a form that will allow the user to enter a mood. They can then use the SoundCloud API to find a song with that mood in it's title (for instance, if the user entered 'happy', it can play 'Don't Worry Be Happy').

The main goal of this project is to strengthen the students understanding of APIs, as well as URL routing, JSON, and HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.). It will also introduce them to the concept of iframes, since SoundCloud requires iframes for their HTML5 widget.

#Before Class
The instructor should familiarize themselves with the SoundCloud API, as well as the Widget API (both included in References)

Be prepared to discuss IFrames (what they do, why they're necessary, etc.).

A student last year did a similar project at a Hackathon, so it's probably best to take a look at that: [LINK PENDING]

While completing this project the student will learn about the concept of iFrames, and will continue to learn about APIs, HTTP methods, and URL routing.

**Paired Programming:**   
While completing this project the student will..

**Version Control:**   
While completing this project the student will be using a Github form to manage their project.

**Code Review:**   
While completing this project the student will conduct a code review in groups at the end of their projects.

**Search Engine Skills:**  
While completing this project the student will use Google to look up information about the SoundCloud APIs.

**Command Line:**  
While completing this project the student will..

**Debugging**

##Web Programming Skills
This project improves the student's web programming skills in the following way. For a description of each skill please refer to the [Year 2 Rubric.](https://docs.google.com/a/scripted.org/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AmfF2axUr9M_dDA0WEV0LWo2MnBUM0JaQnJTYy1sc0E&usp=drive_web#gid=0)

~~A note to curriculum writers: Not all Web Programming Skills need to be addressed in all projects. If a skill is not used in this project please remove it from this page.~~  
**Forms:**  
While completing this project the student will create a form that will accept input from the user (probably through a text field, but also potentially through a dropdown). The student will then create a submit button and perform the API call when the form is submitted by the user.

**http methods:**   
While completing this project the student will use GET methods to retrieve information from the SoundCloud API.

**Routing/ URLs:**   
While completing this project the student will have to properly construct URLs that call the SoundCloud API.

**Templating:**   
While completing this project the student will..

**API:**   
While completing this project the student will have to search against the SoundCloud API to retrieve songs. They will have to examine the API documentation to ensure that they're formatting the call directly.

##Year One Review
This project will improve upon the following skills from the [Year 1 Rubric.](https://docs.google.com/a/scripted.org/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AobNdyExPHV5dGRWMVI0QVpnSWYtczZZT2ZyV01kcmc&usp=drive_web#gid=0)

#During Class

##Do Now
As the students walk into class they are...

##Opening
~~A note to curriculum writers: An introduction of the project. Think of this as a hackathon introduction, get them excited for this work!~~

##Lecture
Before students begin work on this project they must be introduced to the following concepts. The lecturer may decide the best way to deliver these topics.
*

##Project Creation Time
~~A note to curriculum writers: How will the room look while the project is being completed? Are students in groups? Is there storyboarding? How are the teachers assisting? etc..~~

##Closing
~~A note to curriculum writers: How should the day be wrapped up? Was the day modeled like a competition, or could this end with a series of questions and a conversation with the room?~~

##Check for Understanding
~~A note to curriculum writers: How will the teacher know that all the students were successful. How do we know they learned the skills listed above?~~

##How to Submit
The teacher must ask students to share the link to their project on your school's [Project Submission Form.](https://docs.google.com/a/scripted.org/spreadsheets/d/1kaVH9hmkDCbBul19583UMPxl6IJ3-4pHgBQ2BU6TKDk/edit#gid=0)

##Homework
